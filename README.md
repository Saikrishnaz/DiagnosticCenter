# Diagnostic System

Welcome to the Diagnostic System project! This is a major project developed for the final year of Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) program. The Diagnostic System is designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing various medical conditions and diseases based on symptoms reported by patients.

## Overview

The Diagnostic System is an advanced tool that utilizes algorithms and medical knowledge to analyze symptoms provided by patients and generate possible diagnoses. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering patient symptoms, performing diagnostic tests, and generating diagnostic reports. The system aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses, leading to better treatment outcomes and patient care.

## Features

- **Symptom Input**: Allows healthcare providers to input symptoms reported by patients through an intuitive interface.
- **Diagnostic Algorithms**: Utilizes sophisticated algorithms to analyze symptoms and generate potential diagnoses.
- **Medical Database**: Accesses a comprehensive database of medical conditions, diseases, and their associated symptoms for accurate diagnosis.
- **Diagnostic Tests**: Suggests additional diagnostic tests or procedures based on the reported symptoms to further refine the diagnosis.
- **Patient Management**: Stores patient information, medical history, and diagnostic reports for easy access and reference.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed diagnostic reports summarizing the patient's symptoms, potential diagnoses, and recommended treatment options.
- **User Authentication**: Implements user authentication to ensure secure access to patient data and diagnostic tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET)
- **User Interface**: Windows Forms
- **Database**: SQL Server or MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for symptom analysis and diagnosis prediction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diagnostic-system-vbnet.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a new database in SQL Server or MySQL.
   - Import the database schema from the provided SQL script (`database.sql`).
   - Update the database connection string in the project configuration files (`app.config`).

4. Build and run the project.

## Usage

1. Launch the application and log in using your credentials.
2. Enter patient symptoms into the system through the provided interface.
3. Review the generated diagnoses and suggested diagnostic tests.
4. Store patient information and diagnostic reports for future reference.
5. Generate and share detailed diagnostic reports with colleagues or patients as needed.
